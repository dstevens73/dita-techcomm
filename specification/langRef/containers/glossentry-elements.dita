<title>Glossary entry elements</title>
  <shortdesc>The glossary entry specialization contains markup that supports terminological
    information. In addition to recording information for glossaries, it can be used for other
    purposes such as inclusion in a terminology database, extraction for pre-translation, reuse in
    controlled authoring applications, and recording information that may be later retrieved for
    other lexical resources.<draft-comment author="dawnstevens">In this topic set need to decide on
      what to call things: Primary term, preferred term, variant, alternative, etc. I think in
      particular preferred is problematic.</draft-comment></shortdesc>
  <!--<shortdesc>Use the glossary entry topic type to define glossary terms. Each glossentry topic should define a single sense of a term.</shortdesc>-->
